# Indigo CLI

Command-line interface for projects leveraging Stratumn's Indigo platform.

## Usage

Run `indigo-cli generate` to start a new project.

## Advanced

The Indigo CLI uses generator templates to create projects that are ready to run.
We provide generator templates at <https://github.com/stratumn/generators>.
By default, the CLI will use the generators that are tagged with the same version,
but you can provide custom generators using the `--generators-*` command-line switches.
